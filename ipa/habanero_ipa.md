  * Munich LME doesn't exist here.  conversion to 1lb munich malt
  * Crystal 15 was out, did 1lb Crystal 40 and munich malt as a partial mash
  * All hops changed to 4oz simcoe.
2. process
  * 1 hour partial infusion with 1lb munich malt and 1lb C40
  * hop schedule changed to 1oz at each 60/45/30/15 (per brooklyn's ipa)
  * brought volume up to 27L, because christopher can't read too good
  * added 30g hulled and seeded fresh habanero peppers.
  * added 1lb dextrose to compensate for the extra water
3. this was technically christopher's first beer.  !!!!
